# SC-RN-APP

This was my first attempt at mobile development, with the goal of helping a couple of medical students with a startup idea of creating an AI powered Skin Cancer detection app. It connects to a FastAPI backend that serves a model cloned from Hugging Face that was trained on a database of skin lesions. At the end, this project was abandoned after talking to a specialist researcher on the topic that claimed there is no big enough dataset currently to build a production worthy model.
